Description: Debian package update tracking
 The debtrack tool can save the current package installation information
 (essentially that is what "dpkg -l" lists) in a dated checkpoint file
 and later diff the current installation against the last checkpoint.
 .
 It tells you what debdiff currently thinks about the system, i.e. if
 there are any changes to the latest checkpoint and what they are.
 It allows you to post a report (that means sending a mail) to some
 recipient.
 .
 In addition it checks daily for new updates and (optional)
 downloads them.
